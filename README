Mini-SIEM Project by Tal Levinshtein
Mini-SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a lightweight, real-time security monitoring system. It ingests, parses, and analyzes log data to identify potential security threats.

* Components:
- Parser: Ingests and parses security log files, then stores the data in a MySQL database.
- Analyzer: Queries the database to detect anomalies or deviations from normal behavior and triggers security alerts.

* Workflow:
- Log File: Ingest log data from security systems (e.g., firewalls, IDS).
- Database: Parse and insert log data into a MySQL DB using mysql.connector.
- Analysis: The Analyzer searches for deviations and alerts on potential security events.

* Features:
- Real-time analysis of security data.
- Detects anomalies and security incidents.
- Easy integration with MySQL for scalable storage.

* Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- MySQL server
- mysql.connector library

* Usage:
- Log Parsing: Parse your log files and store them in MySQL.
- Event Analysis: Run the analyzer to spot deviations and get alerted about suspicious activities.
